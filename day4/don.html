The film stars Amitabh Bachchan in dual role, alongside Zeenat Aman, Pran, Iftekhar, Om Shivpuri and Satyen Kappu in supporting roles. The music was composed by Kalyanji–Anandji with lyrics written by Anjaan and Indeevar.
<p>Don was the third highest-grossing Indian film of 1978 and was classified a golden jubilee by Box Office India.The film spawned the Don franchise; Javed Akhtar's son Farhan Akhtar created a remake Don: The Chase Begins Again (2006) and its sequel Don 2 (2011), both starring Shah Rukh Khan. It also inspired several South Indian remakes, including the Telugu film Yugandhar (1979) and the Tamil film Billa (1980). Don is also known for its theme music, which was used in the American Dad! episode "Tearjerker" (2008). The intro "Yeh Mera Dil" was sampled by the Black Eyed Peas for the song "Don't Phunk with My Heart" (2005)
